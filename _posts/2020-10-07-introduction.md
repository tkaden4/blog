# About + Introduction

Hi, I'm Kaden Thomas, currently working as a Full Stack Developer and studying to
become an Industrial Automation and Control Systems Engineer.

In this blog post I'll be going over my intentions for this blog, how I got here,
and what to expect from me in terms of content, frequency, and community interaction.

## Backstory

I pursued Mathematics and CS at both **University of Washington Bothell** and **Western Washington University** due
to my passion for software development and the future prospects as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Specialist.
After working as a Full Stack Developer for about a year and a half, I decided that I wanted to pursue opportunities
in Electrical Engineering & Industrial Automation, leading to me dropping out and enrolling in **Bellingham Technical College**'s
Instrumentation and Control Technology program.

## Content

My content will mostly be educational or explanatory in nature, in the hopes that by teaching others I'll sharpen
my own understanding of the subject. Additionally it'll keep me focused on continuing to push forwards in learning
new things, as success in this career path is very dependent on one's ability to stay current.

Subjects will include, but are not limited to:

- PLC Programming
- Electrical Engineering
- Control loops
- Arduino / Raspberry PI
- Open source software

## Frequency

Due to my course load and job situation, I don't expect to create a blog post more than once a week, but I will
work to guarantee at least one. Posts will be published near the end of the weekend.

I'll probably get back to you within a day or two.
