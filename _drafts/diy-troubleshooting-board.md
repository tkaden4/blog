title: "Building a user-friendly troubleshooting training board"
---

As part of my classes, we are expected to show that we are developing troubleshooting skills for electronic circuits.
I decided to build my own troubleshooting board to help me practice my deductive reasoning and to gain more experience
designing circuits.

## The Design

The basic design is just a simple parallel circuit with several points in the circuit that we can take voltage measurements
from. To introduce breaks into the circuit, I used 6 relays to control the continuity between each of the different measurement
points
